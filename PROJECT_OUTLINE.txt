#####################################
Included below are all the planned changes for the mod. Do not add to this list without consulting 
the whole team. The point of this list is for us to keep up to date on what has been implemented 
already and what needs fixing or testing. 

Place a double "@@" infront of the items that have been implemented already, but NOT TESTED.
Place a double "~~" infront of the items that have been implemented and HAVE BEEN TESTED. 
Place a double "!!" infront of the items that need reevaluating or fixing, leave a hash comment.
Leave everything else as is.

~~ 1. Policies need rebalancing so that there is no meta for land/naval nations such as the currently existing Religious/Econ/Quality meta. #simply rebalanced most of the military policies and got rid of most 'no-brainers'

2. Make forts very expensive to build and upkeep and figure out a way to limit how many forts one can have, maybe increase upkeep the more forts one builds.

3. No morale gift (to enemy) or morale loss (to friendlies) when you manually retreat an army (to bring back morale cycling). Maybe need a GUI change to make it easier to select individual armies in a battle.

4. Scorched earth needs to have a way bigger attrition hit and need to do more damage to a province

5. Reduce the spread of the dice in battle from 0-4 and make Mountains -3 terrain penalty and hills -2, everything else -1.

6. Allow sieges to be assaulted regardless of breach and also more effective.

7. Remove lategame forts because they're dumb.

10. Ability to always ally players regardless of relations

11. Make armies more expensive to build and maintain, especially at war (to make economic ideas more viable and make war taxes more useful)

12. Rebalance generals based on army tradition and decrease army tradition of the general from estate action. Give +1 leaders across the board.

13. Remove shattered retreat or make armies always retreat to the CLOSEST friendly province or make armies take attrition damage for every province they cross when in retreat mode

15. Option to choose CNs instead of having them auto-form

~~ 16. No hostile core creation cost, slight rebalance of SOME NIs #Made it more viable to select most NIs and gave specific strategies for guys who want to do vassal games or something like that

17. Decrease initial combat width to make morale cycling more applicable

18. Make trade republics not shit. Add modifier for allying one maybe?

19. Make diplo-vassalising a bit easier

20. Make PU mechanics a bit easier

22. Rebalance estates, they're a bit shitty and often pointless

23. Make the Hansa a thing again, i.e. make Lubeck's allies be vassals. 

24. Decrease base province supply limit i.e. make attrition harsher

25. Make mercs not ridiculous

26. Make reformed/protestant/catholic a choice not a no-brainer

27. Increase global manpower recovery speed

28. Change max loansizes to be smaller, interest to be higher and max loan count to be smaller. This is to stop people from farming loans to mass produce buildings. 

29. Use Sunday League's 1 policy of each group change? Not sure about this one, will ask around. 

30. Some buildings need to be made not useless

31. Give every nation +1 colonist at X diplo tech to encourage everyone to get in on the colony game without having to invest in an NI.
