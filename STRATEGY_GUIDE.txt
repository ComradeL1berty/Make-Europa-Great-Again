Army Management:

The availability of mercenaries has been greatly reduced and bonuses to mercenary pool are generally only found with economic/trade or colonial focused nations (except Burgundy). 
Furthermore, manpower is now more important than ever and managing manpower is a lot more tricky. 
Therefore, it can be very useful to hire rich countries to use their mercenaries on the frontline in order to deplete enemy manpower reserves whilst saving your own.

Warfare:

Forts are sieged quicker now and are very expensive to build and maintain, however, they provide a huge bonus to supply limit in the given province. This makes forts highly strategically valuable.


Economic Management:

Armies and Navies are pretty expensive now, so you definitely need to plan out the economy of your country. You cannot focus only on military infrastructure/ideas.
Trade should now be viable for more than just naval nations. Trade + Defensive gives you a really good policy that will help you secure trade to your home node. Trade buildings will also grant trade good modifier bonuses, but these cannot be built on overseas territory.

NIs and Policies:

You will want to have a look at the CHANGELOG.txt for a list of what's changed with the NIs and Policies. Combos like Religious, Quantity, Quality are no longer as strong.
This means that you have a lot more freedom to put your country in the direction you want to take it, rather than being forced down a path.
